"It's 11:40 p.m. on a Saturday night and I'm doing a quick update for one of the best arcade to console translations for the Atari 2600, Dig Dug. Having a tough final exam coming up in two days, I've decided not to spend time trying to think up a good intro like I usually do with new reviews and updates; a classic memory will have to do. "
