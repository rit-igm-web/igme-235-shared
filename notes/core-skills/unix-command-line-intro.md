# Unix *command line* Intro

## Overview
- Our Web server, gibson.rit.edu, and over half of all Web servers in the world, run on a variant of the Unix operating system. BTW - iOS and Android phones also run on Unix
- Today we will learn how to use a Unix *shell* to interact with the server that gibson runs on, and perform basic file management tasks such as creating/renaming/deleting files and folders, and setting file & folder *permissions*
