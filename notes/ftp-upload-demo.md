# FTP Upload Demo
FTP demo and review (we will do this together in class):
   - Create a local 235 directory, and put a *hello.html* file in it
   - **Reminder:** always keep backups, bring a flash drive to class; the `235` folder on people.rit.edu is where course work will usually be posted

**hello.html**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Hello Page</title>
</head>
   <body>
      <h1>Week 1 in 235!</h1>
      <p>I am stoked about this class!</p>
   </body>
</html>
```
 
1. connect to **`banjo.rit.edu`** with an FTP client - instructions are here: [How to post to RIT's *banjo* web server](posting-to-banjo.md)
1. create a **`235`** folder and place it in your **`www`** folder
1. post *hello.html* to your banjo **`235`** folder
1. review file/folder permissions to be sure they are correct
1. **Reminder:** **`banjo.rit.edu`** is the FTP name, but the browser will access the URL **`people.rit.edu`**
1. navigate a browser to that directory - **`http://people.rit.edu/~abc1234/235/hello.html`** and you should see your *hello.html* page
