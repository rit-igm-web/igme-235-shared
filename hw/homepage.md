# Homework: Create a 235 home page

## I. Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 235 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the projects you will complete for this course.

## II. Requirements
* The page will be named index.html
* The page will be located at `http://people.rit.edu/yourid/235/`
  - This is critical. Please get the location correct. The directory name should just be the three digits, no "igme" with it.  We will make links to everyone's Home Page and they must follow this pattern.

Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 235 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
  - Please see the note about privacy at the end of this section.
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask) -- funny we wrote that long before COVID, but we'd still like to see the real "maskless" you.
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragraph will do), telling us about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to each of the 3 class projects.
  - You do not need to create links to your homework exercises, but you are welcome to do so if you wish.
* A link to your GitHub repo for this class (even if you have no intention of using it)
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout.
  - Try to consider at least some of the principles described in this chapter of a book about presentation design: [The Big Four: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf).  We will revisit these concepts & other design principles in a week or so.
  - We expect you to use the CSS Box Model and positioning to apply basic layout to your page, however, if you read ahead, you may also use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid techniques to improve your layout.
* You should use an *external CSS* file for all of your styles.
  - Your CSS should include at least 2 ID selectors and 2 class selectors (make up a use for them if it doesn't seem like you *need* them).
* You must also change all the anchors (links) on your page to match your color scheme (changing all five states)
* Your page needs to pass validation on [Validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) and the W3C [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* PRIVACY NOTE: The list of links to everyone's names is not publicly listed on the internet.&nbsp; However, since your pages (generally) are available to anyone on the internet if they have your URL, you should still consider that your page *may* be seen by others outside of RIT.&nbsp; For most people this is likely to be no big concern (you might even welcome the opportunity to put your "best face forward" and make a page that you feel comfortable with if other people happened to see it -- we'd even like you to continue to update it and improve it/them as the semester goes on).&nbsp; However, for other people, this may not be desired.&nbsp; You might prefer that your page not be visible outside of RIT (the reasons are many and varied).&nbsp; Discuss this concern with your instructor: we are able to accommodate this concern by allowing you to use the same authentication techniques discussed in a previous exercise.&nbsp; If added security beyond that is necessary we may be able to remove you from the class lists and/or allow you to use an alternative name and/or image for the assignments that would normally require it.

## III. Submission
