# Homework: Design to Spec - 2019-2020

## I. Overview
Web developers commonly work in a team with others such as Content Strategists, User Experience designers, and Graphic Artists.  For this homework, you are being asked to recreate this design that a Graphic Artist built in Photoshop.  Your Goal is to use HTML & CSS (but no frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize) to realize this site as a functional web page.

## II. Requirements
You are to recreate this design:
![Website Mockup](_images/designtospec.png)

This is decidedly NOT a Homework for you to exercise your creativity.

You will be graded on how close you are able to get your page to the appearance of this image.

Source image files and a palette to work with are available here: [Spec Design HW Files](specdesignhw.zip)

This is an individual project, and since everyone is doing the EXACT SAME design, you should guard your code carefully so that it is not made available to others.  We will run a file similarity checker on all submissions for this exercise across all sections to look for instances of academic dishonesty.  There is enough ambiguity in the design and the ways that it gets implemented that everyone's project can certainly be unique.

The only requirements about the way that your design is implemented is that it must use either Flexbox, CSS Grid, or (most likely) both of them to do page layout.

You must also use valid, semantic, HTML & valid CSS stored in an external css file.

The Graphic artist has NOT specified a certain design for mobile, but they would definitely *like* to see you provide a Responsive Design solution that works well.  Responsiveness will be worth up to a 20% bonus to your score, so focus first on the 'wider' version of the page.

The Graphic artist has also NOT specified certain behaviors on the page such as link colors or rollover states for menu links.  You're free to make your own determinations, but don't go far outside of the provided color palette. 

QUESTIONS?  It is not uncommon to need to ask questions of the Graphic Designer so that you get the clearest understanding of the spec.  For the purposes of this assignment, the Graphic Designer will be your course Instructor and spec clarification questions should be asked in YOUR SECTION'S channel.  You can still ask general HTML & CSS questions in the shared html-css-questions channel on Discord, but always be careful not to share your (complete or mostly complete) code to the rest of the class.

If you run into trouble and wish to seek help with a specific question that requires the sharing of your code, do so through a private message to your Instructor.

## III. NON Requirements
- You do not need to guess at page colors.  They are all (except for white and black) specified in included color palette.  
- You do not need to perfectly match the font, however, the headings and menus are in "Arial Rounded MT Bold" and the rest of the text is fine as just "Arial".
- You may use any video game controller icon in the top left corner of the page.  There are many free downloadable SVGs of videogame controllers on the web for you to pick from.
- It is not necessary to crop the images in exactly the same way as the original images, however, we are providing the original images so that they can match more easily.  Don't use the uncropped/high-resolution full-size images.
- There are no specific pixel dimensions for items on the page.  You're probably best off specifying most elements to be flexible in size and/or based off of the rem unit.
- You should use the same heading texts and menu names that we provided, however you do not need to use the same placeholder code.  Use VS Code or another tool to generate "Lorem Ipsum" text for you to hold the spaces open.  Tip:  In VS Code, just type `loremNN` where NN is a number of words that you want followed by Enter, and it will generate a block of text for you.

## IV: Submissions
- You should post your Homework in a subdirectory of your 235 page.  Use a unique folder name (there should be no way to get to it easily from your 235 Home Page).  Zip your files together and upload them to the assignment on myCourses (when it is created), and include a URL to the live version of your page in the comments field.

The Due Date for the assignment is Tuesday, February 18th at the beginning of class... Please check your myCourses Assignments area for submission details.
