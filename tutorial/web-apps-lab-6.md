# Web Apps Lab 6

Easy - just head back to your [Web Apps Lab 3](web-apps-lab-3.md) file (**web-apps-lab-3.html**), make a copy of the file and name it **web-apps-lab-6.html**, and do the (no longer) optional part:

Note: Need a refresher on creating HTML elements from JavaScript: It's in [this part of the WATS](web-apps-4.md).

```javascript
 // Can you figure out how to pull the key and value from the "links" object literal?
 // and put them in the list with clickable links?
let links = {
		"RIT": "http://www.rit.edu",
		"RWAG" : "https://www.facebook.com/RWAGclub",
		"New Media Club" : "http://newmediaclub.cias.rit.edu"
	}
```

It should display like this when done:

1. [RIT](http://www.rit.edu)
1. [RWAG](https://www.facebook.com/RWAGclub)
1. [New Media Club](http://newmediaclub.cias.rit.edu)

When you're finished, save your work for later submission.
