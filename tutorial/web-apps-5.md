# 5 - JavaScript Functions

## Overview
In computer programming, a *function* is a named section of a program that performs a specific task; they are basically "mini programs" within a larger program. 

Functions contain a sequence of statements called the *function body*. There are two advantages to using functions:
1. Reusability
1. Procedural Abstraction

Here is a short,  well-written page that explains what and why these two concepts are important - please take the time to read it: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~zachary/computing/lessons/uces-10/uces-10/node11.html

## I. <a id="section1"></a>About JavaScript Functions

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be *called* (or "invoked"). 

```javascript
// functions are "callable" objects
let greet = function(){console.log("Hello");}; // function expression
greet(); // call it with () - which is the invocation operator - logs "Hello" to console


// regular objects can NOT be "called"
let car = {make:"Yugo"}; // object literal
car(); // "Uncaught TypeError: car is not a function"

```

## II. <a id="section2"></a>Function *Declarations*

Here are some examples of JavaScript function declarations. Note that when we declare a JavaScript function, we do not declare the *type* of the arguments, or the *type* of the return value.

### functions-1.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-1</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// 1 - These first 2 examples do not have a return value, and instead rely on "side effects"

// 1A - no arguments, no return value
function sayHello(){
	console.log("Hello!");
}

// 1B - String argument, no return value
function sayHelloTo(name){
	console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
}

sayHello(); 			// "Hello!"
sayHelloTo("Bob"); 		// "Hello Bob!"
let a = sayHelloTo("Mary"); 	// `a` defaults to `undefined` because this function has no return value


// 2 - these functions DO return values

// 2A - one String argument, String return value
function formatGreeting(name){
	return "Hello " + name + "!";
}

// 2B - here we store the returned value in a variable
let greeting = formatGreeting("Mary");
greeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
console.log(greeting); 	// HELLO MARY!

</script>
</body>
</html>

```

<hr>

### ** *Try This!* **
- In *functions-1.html*, write a function named `greetFull()` that takes separate first and last name arguments, and returns a greeting that uses both of these values.

<hr>


## III. <a id="section3"></a>Function *Expressions*
As *callable* objects, JavaScript functions are treated as *first-class* values. 

This means that like any other JavaScript type (e.g. numbers or strings) they can be referenced by a variable, passed as an argument to a function, and returned as a value by a function.

### functions-2.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-2</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// 1 - Function Expression
let formatGreeting1 = function(name){
	// we are going to use ES6 String template literals instead of concatenation going forward
	return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

let formatGreeting2 = function(name){
	return `Greetings and felicitations, kind ${name}.`;
}

// 1A - we can still call the functions as normal
let greeting = formatGreeting1("Mary");
let greeting2 = formatGreeting2("Mary");

console.log(greeting); 		// Hello Mary!
console.log(greeting2); 	// Greetings and felicitations, kind Mary.


// 2 - A function that takes another function as an argument, and then calls it
function createGreetings(myData,myFunc){
	let greetings = []; // empty array
	for (let n of myData){
		let g = myFunc(n); // call the passed in function and pass in a name
		//let g = myFunc.call(this,n); // does the same thing
		greetings.push(g); // add greeting to array
	}
	return greetings;
}

let names = ["Gary","Larry","Mary","Sherri"];
// 2A - here we pass the names array, and our 1st greeting format function
let greetings1 = createGreetings(names,formatGreeting1); 

// 2B - here we pass the names array, and our 2nd greeting format function
let greetings2 = createGreetings(names,formatGreeting2); 

console.log(greetings1); // ["Hello Gary!", "Hello Larry!", "Hello Mary!", "Hello Sherri!"]
console.log(greetings2); // ["Greetings and felicitations, kind Gary.", "Greetings and felicitations, kind Larry.", "Greetings and felicitations, kind Mary.", "Greetings and felicitations, kind Sherri."]

</script>
</body>
</html>

```

### A. Explanation
- in #1 above, we declared two function expressions
- in #1A above, we see that we can call these functions normally, the same way as we would call a declared function.
- in #2 above, we have declared a function that takes another function as an argument
- as we loop through the array, we call the passed in function repeatedly
- in #2A & #2B above we call `createGreetings()` with 2 different functions passed in

**Passing function references around in this manner might seem strange, but it is commonly done in JavaScript programming.**

## IV. <a id="section4"></a>Default function parameters
In JavaScript, parameters of functions default to `undefined`. However, in some situations 
it might be useful to set a different default value. This is where **default parameters** can help.

### functions-3.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-3</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// #1 - A standard JavaScript function, it does not handle missing arguments well
function multiply1(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(multiply1(2,5)); // 10
console.log(multiply1(2));   // we omit the b parameter, the result is NaN (Not a Number), because b is undefined


// #2 - by checking the value of b before using it, we can give it a default value 
function multiply2(a, b) {
  b = (typeof b !== 'undefined') ?  b : 1; // ternary operator
  return a * b;
}

console.log(multiply2(2,5)); 	// 10
console.log(multiply2(2)); 	// 2, because b will default to 1


// #3 - this is much easier with ES6 default parameters
function multiply3(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(multiply3(2,5)); 	// 10
console.log(multiply3(2)); 	// 2, because b has a default value of 1


</script>
</body>
</html>
```
### A. Explanation
- note the behavior in #1 when the second parameter is left out. We get a result of `NaN` (Not a Number) because when `undefined` is multiplied by anything, the result is always `NaN`
- note in #2 that we are using the *ternary operator*, which is a shortcut if/then/else. This also illustates one way to check to see if a value is undefined.
- note in #3 that default function parameters are an ES6 feature

## V. <a id="section5"></a>Variable Scope (`let` & `const`)
Both functions and variables that are declared using either `let` or `const`, are *scoped* to the current *block* they were declared in.

- A **Block** is delimited by a pair of curly braces `{}` and is used to group zero or more statements.
- **Scope** means where your variable is accessible and modifiable in your program.
- Functions and variables declared by `let` and `const` have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. 
- If a variable is declared with `let` and `const` **outside** of a block (at the top-level of the &lt;script> element) it has **script** scope. Script scope means that the variable is available throughout the current script, and in other &lt;script> tags.

### functions-4.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-4</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// #1 - a & b here are in "script scope" because they are declared outside of a block
let A = "A";
let B = "B";


// #2 a function 
function func1(){
	let A = "AA"; // A scoped to this function's block masks the "script scoped" A
	console.log(`INSIDE func1() A equals ${A}`); // "AA"
	console.log(`INSIDE func1() B equals ${B}`); // "B" - "script scoped" b is visible
	B = "BB"; // change value of "script scoped" B
	let C = "C"; // declare a block-scoped C variable
	debugger; // debugger breakpoint
}

func1(); // call func1()
console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() A equals ${A}`); // "A" - A is in scope

console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() B equals ${B}`); // "BB" -  B is in scope

//console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() C equals ${C}`); // reference error! C is not defined

debugger; // debugger breakpoint

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
### A. Explanation
Be sure to run this example in Chrome with the web inspector open (see screenshot below). The `debugger;` statement will suspend execution of the program and allow us to inspect both the value of the variables,  and their *scope*. 
Note that we have 3 scopes here: "Local", "Script", and "Global".
- `func1()` has 2 "locally" scoped variables (i.e. to the function *block*) - `A` and `C`.
- `A` and `B` are "script" scoped and are thus visible throughout this page and other scripts of the page.
- There are 2 `A` variables here - one in script scope, the other in local scope. The locally scoped `A` in `func1()` will "mask" the script scoped A within `func1()`.
- There are many globally scoped objects - alerts, arrays, the `Math` object, and so on. Functions that we create at the top level with the `function` keyword are also in the global scope. Our scripts have full access to these and other global variables.
- **Try this**: Remove the `debugger;` statements and uncomment the final `console.log()` that tries to print out `C`. Of course it fails because we can't access local variables from outside the block in which they were declared in.

## VI. <a id="section6"></a>Variable Scope with the `var` keyword
- Variables declared with the `var` keyword (which we have NOT been using in this course) are scoped to the nearest enclosing *function* in which they were declared, they are NOT *block scoped*.
- If a variable is declared with the `var` keyword *outside* of a function, that variable is now in the *global scope*.

You can read about this behavior of `var` and other behaviors such as variable declaration **hoisting** and **global scope** here:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var

## VII. <a id="section7"></a>Nested variable declarations
### functions-5.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-5</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
function doStuff(){
	let x = 1;
	let y = 1;
	if(x==1){
		x++;
		y++;
		let z = 1; // z is scoped to the `if()` block
	}
	console.log(x); // 2
	console.log(y); // 2
	console.log(z); // ReferenceError: z is not defined!
}

doStuff();

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
### A. Explanation
- z above is scoped to the inner "if" block, and is not visible outside of that block.


## VIII. <a id="section8"></a>Nested functions
We can declare a function *within* a function. The nested (inner) function is private to its containing (outer) function. 
Below we have given the `addSquares()` function a "helper" function that is not visible from the outside of `addSquares()`.

### functions-6.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-6</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// borrowed from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions
function addSquares(a, b) {
  function square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
  return square(a) + square(b);
}

let a = addSquares(2, 3); // returns 13
let b = addSquares(3, 4); // returns 25
let c = addSquares(4, 5); // returns 41

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
- The inner function (`square`) can be accessed only from statements in the outer (`addSquares`) function.
- This inner function (`square`) forms a *closure*: the inner function can use the arguments and variables of the outer function, while the outer function **cannot** use the arguments and variables of the inner function.

Closures are an important topic in JavaScript - you can learn more about them here: 

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Nested_functions_and_closures
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures


## IX. <a id="section9">The "Temporal Dead Zone" and Hoisting

### A. Declared functions
Functions that are declared and defined with the `function` keyword are available for use within their entire scope, even if code that calls them is placed before they have been declared. Here is an example:

```javascript
doStuff(); // this is Legal!

function doStuff(){
   ...
}
```

This works because with declared functions, their name and definition (implementation) are both "hoisted" to the top of the scope by the JavaScript runtime, and thus made immediately available to all of the code in that scope.

### B. Function expressions declared with `let`
But function expressions that are declared with `let` will NOT be available.

```javascript
doStuff(); // ERROR! - "Uncaught ReferenceError: doStuff is not defined"

let doStuff = function(){
   ...
}
```

To fix this, we have to move the call to `doStuff()` below where it was declared and defined:

```javascript
let doStuff = function(){

}

doStuff(); // this is Legal!
```

### C. Other variables declared with `let`
Other variables declared with `let` work the same way - the declaration is NOT available:

```javascript
// Bad! "Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined"
x ++;
let x = 0; 

// Good!
let y = 0;
y ++; // `y` is now equal to 1
```

### D. Variables declared with `var`
Variables declared with `var` are - of course - a little weird. The declaration IS hoisted to the top of the function scope, but the definition (assigned value) is NOT:

```
function doStuff(){
	var x = 10;
	x++;

	y++;
	var y = 10;

	console.log(`x=${x}`); // 11
	console.log(`y=${y}`); // 10
}

doStuff();
```

`x` behaves as we expect. 

For `y`:
- the definition of `y` will be hoisted to the top of the function and given a value of `undefined`
- the `++` operator on undefined gives `y` a value of `NaN`
- the value of 10 is then assigned to `y`

**So what is the "Temporal Dead Zone"?**
For variables declared with `let` or `const`, there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. This period is known as the temporal dead zone (TDZ).

## X. <a id="section10"></a>ES6 Arrow Functions
Arrow functions are an ES6 addition.  They have two advantages: they have a shorter syntax than regular functions, and they do not bind their own `this` keyword. This second advantage might not mean anything to you now, but we will revisit it in a future chapter of this tutorial.

### functions-7.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Functions-7</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
"use strict";
// 1 - function declaration
function addThem1(num1,num2){
	return num1 + num2;
}

// 2 - function expression
let addThem2 = function(num1,num2){
	return num1 + num2;
}

// 3 - arrow function with the usual "block body"
let addThem3 = (num1,num2) => {return num1 + num2;}

// 4 - arrow function with a "concise body" and implied return statement
let addThem4 = (num1,num2) => num1 + num2;

// They all do the same thing
console.log(addThem1(5,5)) // 10
console.log(addThem2(5,5)) // 10
console.log(addThem3(5,5)) // 10
console.log(addThem4(5,5)) // 10

// 5 - and here's an even more concise version, if the function has only a single argument the
// parentheses can be omitted
let doubleIt = num => num * 2;
console.log(doubleIt(5));

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
### A. Explanation
- 4 of the 5 function definitions above do the same thing, but the syntax is increasingly concise. 
- Arrow functions really come in handy with arrays, when you can to pass them as arguments to functions such as `.sort()` or `.filter()` or `.forEach()`, which we will work with soon.
- Arrow function docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions.

**Note: not everyone thinks that the more concise syntax of arrrow functions is advantageous in that they are sometimes less readable than functions written with the tradtional `function` syntax. Our advice: use arrow functions wherever you don't need or want `this` binding, and where they make your code more clear.**

## XI. <a id="section11"></a>Nota bene

A. We have not yet talked about the `this` keyword - `this` has a special value within functions based on how it is called - we will take a closer look at `this` in the next section, JavaScript Events & `this`.

B. A new kind of function for ES6 is called a **Generator Function** - which is a function that can be paused and later resumed. We will not be covering them in this course. If you are interested, here is some information about them:

- http://thejsguy.com/2016/10/15/a-practical-introduction-to-es6-generator-functions.html
- https://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators

C. We are going to use String Template literals in our examples instead of string concatentation going forward. But there is one caveat - Internet Explorer 11 (the final version of IE) does not support them, so be cautious about using them in your "shipping" JavaScript projects.

D. You may have noticed **global** variable scope above. How can you add variables to this **global** scope?
1. Use the `var` keyword outside of a function definition  (we will avoid using `var` in this class)
2. Every time you give an element an `id` value, you are actually creating a property on the global `.window` object. You can read about this here:

http://2ality.com/2012/08/ids-are-global.html

This "auto creation" of global properties is a feature you probably don't want to use in your code, but you need to be aware of it because it can cause quirky behavior in your programs depending on how you "id" your elements.
